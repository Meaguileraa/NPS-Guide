# National Park Service Guide

## About
NPS Guide is a site where users can view available activities at a given national park and select their preferred activities to add to a bucketlist. The inspiration for my project stems from my passion for exploring national parks, where I save activities in my phone that I want to check out while I am there. NPS Guide is a perfect solution!
